## If you are working on back-end:

#### Lift server without api-tests:
```
grunt lift
```

#### Lift server with api-tests:
```
grunt testLift
```

#### Run only api-tests: run, baby, run
```
grunt testServer
```

## If you are working on front-end:

#### Run server:
Will lift sails in current cmd, and open new cmd for front-end.
```
grunt liftFront
```

## Important
All code need to be covered by tests.

## Troubleshooting
Please make sure you have mongo started before running server.
If you see error after pulling repo, please try to make `npm install`.
